									<div class="client-review"><span class="client">Chris Cleveland - CEO at Dieselpoint Inc. </span>Gideon Grossman has worked as a software developer at Dieselpoint for a year and a half. I was lucky to get him. If you persuade him to join your team, you'll agree that you got lucky as well.

										Gideon worked on a new type of CRM. To do that, he had to learn Java, Vue/Nuxt/Javascript, a lot about Postgres and databases, and a lot about devops on AWS. He learned fast and didn't need any training. He knows how to pick up a book and get it done on his own.
										
										His experience was definitely full-stack. For example, I asked him to build the deduplication module. I pointed to a few examples of other systems that had this function, and we talked about the UX and general strategy. He designed the tables on the backend, created the dedupe algorithms on the app server, added a REST interface, and developed the UX in Vue. It was all him. Not many developers can do that.
										
										I made the same request for the maps component of our app. This was a lot harder because there were difficult performance issues around displaying large amounts of data on a map. He evaluated third-party solutions (we cycled through several of them), wrote some geocoding logic, figured out how to aggregate map data efficiently, designed the interfaces, created the front end (Leaflet, later MapBox) and made it all work.
										
										He worked remotely during this entire time, first in San Diego, later Costa Rica, finally Hawaii. We did a daily Zoom call. Despite the distance and lack of direct supervision, his productivity was terrific. Every morning I'd be surprised at how much he got done. He is disciplined and reliable.
										
										Get him if you can.

								<div class="client-review"><span class="client">Jo√£o Ricardo - Android / Java Engineer </span>I worked with Gideon in a project for Globelet, I was building the backend and he was working on the front end. He is very passionate about technology, very easy to communicate with, easy to work with and delivers results in a timely fashion.
